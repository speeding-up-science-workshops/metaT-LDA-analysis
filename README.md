Title:  Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to help determine relationships and structure in microbial communities.  LDA is a Bayesian based method which infers these relationships by grouping sequence data into communities and determining the likelihood of these communities comprising a given sample.  The approach can easily be applied to any metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data set which has resulted in a count table of taxonomy or gene functions.
