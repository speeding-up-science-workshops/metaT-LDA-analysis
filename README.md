A repo intended to run LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
in a notebook on MyBinder.org.

## Summary: 

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to help determine relationships and structure in microbial communities.  LDA is a Bayesian based method which infers these relationships by grouping sequence data into communities and determining the likelihood of these communities comprising a given sample.  The approach can easily be applied to any metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data set which has resulted in a count table of taxonomy or gene functions.
